<p>I don't have all that much to say about iOS 7. Honestly, I don't hope that it has a completely redesigned UI, a flat interface, or anything like that. What I hope is that it has an exciting new set of features, a slightly tweaked springboard, and a better way for apps to talk to each other and share data. I don't want a huge interface overhaul, or a shift in UX paradigms that I've come to know by muscle memory. I want things like <a title="iOS 7 Wishes" href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-7-wishes/" target="_blank">what Viticci suggests</a>: minor changes to the overall experience to make it much better on the whole.</p>
<p>I for one am not unhappy at all with iOS 6 as it is right now. Sure, there are a few things that are slightly annoying, but nothing that is a showstopper for me. It does what I want it to when I want it to. I don't mind the linen, and while it's not exactly the most pleasing to the eye, it's not annoying at all.</p>
<p>I just hope that iOS 7 keeps the great parts about iOS as they are, and makes minor upgrades to some of the things that don't work as well as they should. I want something that makes me say <em>wow</em> again, not something that changes how I work. Is that too much to ask for?</p>
