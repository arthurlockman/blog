<p>On what would seemingly be a<a href="http://www.macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/25092/#"> normal and completely sane post</a> with Woz giving his opinion on the whole <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/" title="Adobe Flash" rel="homepage">Flash</a>/Apple debate, there is a small portion under the video that I find a little disturbing. Let's take a look at what it says. Under the video, we see this little paragraph that has me completely baffled.&nbsp;
<div></div>
<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; "><font color="FF0000" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "><b style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: rgb(255, 1, 1); display: inline; font-size: 1em; ">MacDailyNews Note:&nbsp;</b></font></span></div>
<p><b style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ">Note to advertisers:</b>&nbsp;(including those who advertise via third-party ad networks and become, in effect,&nbsp;<i style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ">our</i>&nbsp;advertisers): Your Flash-based ads are no longer reaching the most well-heeled customers online: 50+ million <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" title="iPhone" rel="homepage">iPhone</a> owners. They're also not hitting 35+ million <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" title="IPod Touch" rel="wikipedia">iPod touch</a> users or 1+ million brand new <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" title="iPad" rel="homepage">iPad</a> users. If you care about reaching people with discretionary income, you might want to consider dumping your flash-based ads and moving to a more open format that people with&nbsp;<i>money</i>&nbsp;and the will to spend it can actually see.</div>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; "><br /></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; "></span>This to me is absurd. How can Mac Daily News honestly think that they are right in saying this? First of all, the iDevice market is not the biggest market out there as of right now. What about all those people who still use these neat things called computers to look at the internet? You're still reaching them if you advertise with flash. Maybe the mobile market is big, but the desktop market is still bigger. Also what gets me about this article is the fact that it says "if you care about reaching people with discretionary income..." Well let me tell you something. I have discretionary income and I do not own an iPad or iPhone or any such device. I know plenty of people with 'discretionary income' who do not own an iDevice. Therefore that statement is completely bogus. Another problem with this article that I have is that if you look at the bottom of the page it says "Help kill <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.adobe.com/" title="Adobe Systems" rel="homepage">Adobe</a>'s flash". That has me mad. Why would they want to kill one of the most versatile and open desktop and mobile (android) platforms&nbsp;available? That to me makes no sense whatsoever. Also I think that Mac Daily News needs to hold themselves to their own standard and stop using the horrible adobe flash to display their videos. If <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" title="HTML5" rel="wikipedia">HTML5</a> is really better according to them, they should use it themselves.&nbsp;</div>
