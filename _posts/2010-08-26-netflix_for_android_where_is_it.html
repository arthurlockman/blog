<p>Today, Netflix released its app that allows netflix streaming video to iPhone devices. This would be great for me, if only I had been graced with an iOS device. I am an avid apple fanboy as you know, but I broke with tradition to buy an Android device. So this leaves me wondering: where is my Netflix for Android? I heard all the rumors, but have seen no result. So I leave it to you. When do you think we'll see Netflix for us android users? Leave your answers in the comments!<br />
All for Now!</p>
