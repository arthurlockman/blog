<p>Well, it's no secret;<a href="http://www.bumptop.com/"> BumpTop</a> is out in the wild for Mac! For me at least, it has replaced Finder for the short term if not for the long run.</p>

<p>At first look, wow. BumpTop is great. And you'd be right. It completely replaces finder on your mac, and integrates all the functionality of it. you can still access all the features of finder; QuickLook, spaces, and any other features that you rely on. They all work. Opening a folder opens a Finder window on top of everything. Amazing. However, there are a few great features that I'd like to highlight for everyone. </p>
<p><img src="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/Stacks.jpg" width="83" height="84" align="left" />The first of these features that makes BumpTop so much better than Finder is the ability to stack items on top of each other. You can select a whole pile of items, and turn them into a stack, just as you would on a regular desk. <img src="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/StacksScrolling.jpg" width="158" height="84" align="right" /></p>
<p>In the Pro version, you can use the two-finger scrolling on your trackpad to flip through the stacks. If you don't have pro, you can double click the stacks and they will open in a grid view that looks very similar to the grid view in Mac OS when you open a dock stack. Soo much better than finder, for so many reasons. </p>
<p><img src="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/GrowShrink.jpg" width="178" height="182" align="left" />Another great feature that I'd like to highlight is the ability to control the size of items on your desktop. you can click on an item, and grow or shrink it depending on its importance to you, just as bigger documents would be on a real desk. You can grow and shrink them to make them suit your needs. </p>
<p>The last thing that I'd like to highlight is the walls that you have to put things on. You can double click on any of the four walls to move the camera view to that wall, on which you can pin stuff, like a real wall. This gives you that extra bit of desktop real estate when ever you need it.</p>
<p>The one feature that I would love to see built in is the ability to span multiple monitors. It is not currently there, but I'm sure it will appear in the future. I highly recommend BumpTop for mac and windows, even with its $30 price tag.</p>
<p>All for Now!<br/></p>
