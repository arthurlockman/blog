<p>Yesterday, as everyone already knows, the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" title="iPad" rel="homepage">iPad</a> came out, to the excitement of millions of people. Now, I'll agree that this device is revolutionary, although I haven't actually laid my hands on one just yet. I decided not to go to the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com" title="Apple" rel="homepage">Apple</a> store yesterday to try one out, despite my geek urges to touch the new Apple gadget. I also decided that in this first round of iPad releases, I won't be getting one. For one thing, this fingerprint resistant coating that is supposed to be on the iPad has been reported to be not fingerprint resistant. Also, I do not believe that I will be able to charge the thing on my early <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook" title="MacBook" rel="wikipedia">MacBook</a>, because the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus" title="Universal Serial Bus" rel="wikipedia">USB</a> ports may not be powered enough. I still think that this is a big mistake by Apple, as the majority of their users are still using these older Macs which may not be able to charge these devices. If I were to be planning to buy one, I would definitely be waiting for the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G" title="3G" rel="wikipedia">3G</a> one anyways. And that's not supposed to ship for a while, so there's a major roadblock for me. It also has no camera, which I really want to see in this device. Until then, I probably won't be buying one. I expect a camera in the next iteration of the iPad, so then I may get one. We'll just have to wait and see.
