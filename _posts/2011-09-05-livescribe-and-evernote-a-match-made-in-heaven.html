<p>Recently, I picked up a Livescribe Echo Smartpen. I needed it for school, plus I wanted to see just how well it works with Evernote. I am pleased to report that it works excellently. Livescribe connect is able to easily process and upload all my pages to Evernote, where they are OCR'd (is that the right verb?) in the cloud. This whole process is seamless, and fantastic. As I get into using it more, i'll make another post detailing every pro and con that I can find with the pen, and its integration with Evernote.</p>
<p>All for Now!</p>
