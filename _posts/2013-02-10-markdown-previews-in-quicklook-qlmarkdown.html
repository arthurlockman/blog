<p>I stumbled across a plugin for QuickLook on the Mac today that allows you to preview Markdown files right in the QuickLook pane. It's called <a title="QLMarkwodn" href="https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown" target="_blank">QLMarkdown, written by Phil Toland</a>. Installation is a simple drag and drop. You can style the previews how you like too, just edit the styles.css file and you're all set. It works really well, and I highly recommend you install it.</p>
