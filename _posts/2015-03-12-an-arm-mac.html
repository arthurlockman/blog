<p>With the launch of the new MacBook, I'm starting to think that the ARM-based Mac might soon become a reality. People have been talking about it and speculating on its launch for years, but now I think it might become very possible for a few reasons. The first of which stems from a tweet today from @sajii:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The MacBook 12" has a logic board only twice the size of the logic board of the iPhone 6. <a href="http://t.co/92ztXUEumn">pic.twitter.com/92ztXUEumn</a></p>

<p>This shows something interesting. Theoretically now an iPhone or iPad logic board could fit comfortably in a MacBook chassis, requiring (theoretically) little-to-no modification to the chassis itself. This paired with the comparatively enormous battery in the MacBook would lead to tremendous battery life in an ARM powered device.</p>
<p>The switchover to Intel Core-M processors in the new MacBook also leads me to think that perhaps this Mac is aimed more at tablet users who want a little more than the iPad can provide (or think they do). The iPad has already shown that it is an <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/" target="_blank">extremely capable computer</a>&nbsp;and that the iPad's processor&nbsp;can <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/192628-the-ipad-air-2-with-a-tri-core-cpu-is-almost-as-fast-as-a-modern-pc" target="_blank">match the performance of an Intel Core-U</a> chip<sup id="fnref-781-1"><a href="#fn-781-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. To me it seems like a no-brainer to start making a transition to an ARM/A8X-based Macbook.</p>
<p>Lastly I'm almost certain that Apple does have a version of OS X that runs on ARM chips. OS X and iOS share many frameworks and most of a kernel already<sup id="fnref-781-2"><a href="#fn-781-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I think that they have all of the pieces and engineering resources to make that happen.</p>
<p>It might not come in the next year, or even the next 5. But I do believe that this new MacBook is the first signal we've seen of a real possibility of an ARM-based Mac. All of the pieces are coming together. Hopefully they come together soon.</p>

Theoretically a Core-U chip <em>should</em> be more performant than its Core-M cousin, meaning that an iPad Air could theoretically be more powerful than this MacBook.&#160;<a href="#fnref-781-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

Not to mention the fact that Apple already proved that they have the technology to make code from one architecture run on another through an interpretation layer with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)" target="_blank">Rosetta</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref-781-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
