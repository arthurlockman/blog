<p>After 30 or so hours without power from Hurricane Irene, everything here is mostly alright. My website had a bunch of downtime, which is the only downside to having self-hosting. Other than that, the only major loss was our tree fort from the back yard. Let's hope we can fix it.</p>
<p>I hope everyone else who was affected by the hurricane is safe and healthy, and making sure that all their things are still in order.</p>
<p>All for Now!</p>
