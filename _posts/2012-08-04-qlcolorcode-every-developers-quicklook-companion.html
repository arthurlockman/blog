<p>A major problem with QuickLook on the Mac is that it doesn't provide syntax highlighting for code files. Well, an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qlcolorcode/">extension called Qlcolorcode</a> does just that. Once installed, it provides QuickLook syntax highlighting for a ton of code files on the Mac. It's really neat, and I recommend everyone check it out.</p>
