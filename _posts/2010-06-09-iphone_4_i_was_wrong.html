<p>Well, previously I <a href="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/2010/04/iphone-4g-i-think-not.html">gave my thoughts on the validity</a> of a 'leaked' <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" title="iPhone" rel="homepage">iPhone</a> 4. As made apparent at <a class="zem_slink" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/" title="WWDC" rel="homepage">WWDC</a> this year, i was wrong. I for one do like the new iPhone design, although i have not held one in my hand yet. I want to as soon as it is available, to see if it really is as amazing as it is said to be. I'll post a review as soon as I get my hands on one.
