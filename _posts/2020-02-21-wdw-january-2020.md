Last month I had the pleasure of taking a short vacation with my fianc√©e and best friends to Walt Disney World to check out the new Rise of the Resistance ride at Hollywood Studios and to enjoy the annual Epcot Festival of the Arts. The four of us take a lot of trips to Disney, but this time was special because there was something new and exciting to see. We're all serious Epcot fans so the double whammy of the festival and the new ride was irresistible.

## Port Orleans - French Quarter

This trip was our first time staying at Port Orleans. We chose to stay at French Quarter because it's a much smaller resort than it's sister Riverside, which means that no matter what room you're in you're never far from the food court or transportation. We ended up in building 7 which was the furthest from the buses, but the walk only took a few minutes. Not bad.

The whole resort is themed like New Orleans, as the name would suggest. Walking down the streets at night almost feels like you're there. They even serve freshly made beignets (which are absolutely delicious)! Completing the ambiance are horse-drawn carriage rides and car-free streets between hotel buildings.

Overall I loved Port Orleans and I'm glad we chose to stay here this time. I recommend choosing this over a value resort if it's available. I think I'd even recommend staying here over a couple of deluxe resorts if I'm honest. The value for the money here is unbeatable elsewhere on property.

## Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge

This was our third time visiting Galaxy's Edge. We had the pleasure of visiting first in August for passholder previews _before_ the land opened, and we've been back one more time since.

Even having visited so many times it never ever gets old. The feeling you get when walking in through the tunnel near MuppetVision is still so sublime. It really truly does feel like you've stepped out of the Florida sun and onto another planet. Every detail is attended to. Everywhere you look there's something new to catch your eye and delight you. If you haven't been to either this or Batuu in California I can't recommend it enough.

## Rise of the Resistance

Oh boy. *Oh my.* **Oh my goodness**. This ride is the real deal. It's better than everything you've heard about it. There are so many things inside the ride that I'm still thinking about, and despite having watched The Imagineering Story and being an engineer myself I still can't figure out how they did it. It's that good. If you have _any_ affection for Star Wars you should ride this ride. It's worth it.

Rather than describe the ride in detail every scene and feature, I'll let the pictures I took do the talking. [^1]

I love this ride. I can't wait until May when I can go on it again.

### Boarding Groups

One piece of the ride that's gotten a lot of press is the new boarding group system. Effectively the boarding groups are just a virtual queue. You get to the park well before it opens, tap a few buttons in the Disney app, and then go about your day until it's your turn. Easy (theoretically).

We caught a Lyft from our hotel at 6 AM. We were in the park (through security and the ticket gate) by around 6:30 AM. Then we waited for park open, which was that day at 7:00 AM. Around 6:58 AM an announcement started that told us how to use the app to get boarding groups. As soon as the announcement started I clicked in to the boarding group section of the app and was able to join one at 6:59 AM while the announcement was still going on. We managed to get boarding group 15 and were on the ride before 8 AM.

A friend of mine was able to use the same method a week later and get boarding group 4. So, my advice is **listen for that announcement, and as soon as it starts try to get a group**. It's been used to great success!

## Other Fun

[^1]: Don't expect to be able to get good pictures on this ride. Aside from a few small parts the whole thing moves _so fast_ that it's hard to pause and get a good shot of anything.
