<p>I had some more thoughts on the new MacBook's logic board that didn't fit so well into my <a title="An ARM Mac" href="http://b.rthr.me/2015/03/an-arm-mac/" target="_blank">post from yesterday</a>. The new tiny low-power logic board from the new MacBook could open up a whole new world of possibilities for a lot of existing Apple products. A Mac Mini powered by the a board of that size&nbsp;that can fit in your pocket for traveling is one<sup id="fnref-791-1"><a href="#fn-791-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. A next-generation&nbsp;ï£¿TV with more powerful hardware and a diminutive size. It also opens the possibility for Apple to be able to move more back into the education market with smaller computers that could have a better performance to price ratio, all powered by the small new logic board. ARM-based or not, it could open a whole new world of possibilities.</p>
<p>I think there's also a possibility of some sort of standardization in terms of the logic boards in some of the lower-end Macs. I can see a time in the future where the MacBook 12", the Mac Mini, and the low-end iMac all use the same exact logic board with slightly different processor and memory configurations. Then like with the iPad Air and Mini, and the iPhone 6/s, the choice of which computer to buy really is only about the size<sup id="fnref-791-2"><a href="#fn-791-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It makes the choice of which to buy much easier for a lot of people, which I think would be really good.</p>
<p>Who knows, this thing could potentially end up powering the mythical iPad Pro<sup id="fnref-791-3"><a href="#fn-791-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

Got the idea from twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/forgottentowel/status/576409798587068416">@forgottentowel</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref-791-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

It's about the size up until the point where you actually care about performance. For a lot of potential Mac buyers I don't really think that the performance is as big of a deal as it might be for us nerds.&#160;<a href="#fnref-791-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

Considering the new MacBook is almost identical to an iPad with a keyboard (almost identical IO configuration with one port for data and power and a headphone jack;&nbsp;low-power draw; Retina display; etc.), I don't think this thought is so far fetched.&#160;<a href="#fnref-791-3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
