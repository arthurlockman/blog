<p>From what I've seen of the tablet market of today, Angry Birds is the true measure of whether or not your tablet will make it. The Kindle Fire, iPad, Nook Tablet, and most if not all of the android tablets have angry birds on them. Which one wasn't on that list? The PlayBook. Which tablet is failing all across the board to sell? The PlayBook. Whenever someone asks if my playbook can play Angry Birds, I have to say no. I just think it's interesting how, in the eye of the public, Angry birds is the true measure of a tablet. Forget specs, screen sizes, or actual user experience. If it can't play Angry Birds, it won't survive.</p>
<p>All for now.</p>
