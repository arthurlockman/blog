<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="adobe-max-2011.jpg" src="https://static.rthr.me/2011/10/adobe-max-2011.jpg" border="0" alt="Adobe max 2011" width="525" height="101" /></p>
<p>I saw a post on Cult of Mac today, whose title really got my blood boiling.<a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/116622/why-in-the-world-is-adobe-holding-an-event-during-apples-keynote-on-tuesday/"> "Why in the World is Adobe Holding an Event during Apple's Keynote on Tuesday?"</a></p>
<p>They attempt to make the claim that Adobe intentionally scheduled <a href="http://max.adobe.com/">MAX</a> during the Apple keynote on tuesday, where the next iPhone will probably be announced. This, I must say, is a load of hooey. MAX has been on the calendar for over a year as being this coming week, and the Apple keynote has been around how long? About a week. They cannot begin to make the claim that that is the case, and have it be anywhere near the truth.</p>
<p>The article takes yet another stab at Adobe by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none;">"We would normally ask what event you&rsquo;ll be tuning into, but let&rsquo;s be honest. All eyes will be on Apple."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like this, while it may hold a little bit of truth, isn't the complete truth. While I do love Apple as a company, an idea, and a brand, I do not believe that all eyes will be on Apple, as they say. Mine certainly will be on MAX. Even though I can't attend MAX this year, it's all the more reason for me to watch and see what's happening. I could honestly care less about what happens in the keynote from Apple. It doesn't affect me in the slightest. All I care about is what the next iPhone looks like when it's done, and whether or not I can get my hands on one. I probably can't. But, at MAX, all of the technologies that will come pouring out of it I will be able to get my hands on. I'll leverage them into my apps, and into my life. Apple products are just apple products. MAX is true innovation. And that's where I stand.</p>
<p>And so, Cult of Mac, you have lost an up till now loyal subscriber. While at one time I did enjoy your posts, it's clear now you wish nothing more than to just stir up anger against Adobe, something that I do not believe in.</p>
