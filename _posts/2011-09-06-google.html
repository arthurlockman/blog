<p>I've noticed recently that not many people that I regularly communicate with are on Google+. Well, right now, I vow to change that for the better. For anyone who still does not have a Google+ account, <a href="https://plus.google.com/i/VQdmyzCJijI:-dFZja6sktI">here's an invite on me!</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Please note, there are only 150 available at the moment, so first come first serve!</p>
