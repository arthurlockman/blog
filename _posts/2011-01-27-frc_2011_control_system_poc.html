<p>This is just a short clip of our 2011 FRC Robot control system Proof of Concept. The main idea here is that the user wears a gauntlet, which controls the manipulator arm on the robot. Here we having it controlling a servo driven apparatus at a much smaller scale than will be on the robot, but we were attempting to see how the whole setup would work.</p>
