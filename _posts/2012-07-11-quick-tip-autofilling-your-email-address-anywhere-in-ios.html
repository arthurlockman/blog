<p>Ever wanted to have a quick way to post your email address in iOS with just a few taps? While Apple hasn't implemented a key to do this, there is a quick way to do it on iOS, provided you're running iOS 5 or higher. Here's a quick guide:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-352 alignright" title="Photo 1" src="https://static.rthr.me/2012/07/Photo-1.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="346" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;</strong>Navigate through the settings app on your iOS device to your keyboard shortcuts (Settings > General > Keyboard > Shortcuts).</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Define a new shortcut with the (+) button in the upper righthand corner.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> in the "Phrase" field, type your email address. In the "Shortcut" field, type the few key shortcut you wish to use for your email address. Once you've done that, save it.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:&nbsp;</strong>Type your shortcut in any iOS text field and watch your email expand automatically.</li>
</ul>
