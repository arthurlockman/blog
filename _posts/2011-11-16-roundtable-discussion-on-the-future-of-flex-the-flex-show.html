<p>This week, the episode of The Flex Show podcast is about the future of Flex following the announcement on Flash Player Mobile being killed. The podcast is in a roundtable format, with me, Sim Bateman, and Ashkay Dave. This was recorded prior to the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/flex/2011/11/your-questions-about-flex.html">blog post from Deepa and Andrew Shorten</a>, and they are planning on organizing another one to discuss those announcements as well.</p>
<p>For now though, <a href="http://www.theflexshow.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/11/16/Future-of-FlexFlash-Roundtable-discussion-The-Flex-Show-Episode-156">go get the podcast!</a> It has lots of good opinions and ideas, and really gets into flex in the real world.</p>
<p>All for now!</p>
