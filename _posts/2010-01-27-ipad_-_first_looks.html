<p><img src="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/www.apple.png" width="200" height="242" align="right" />I'm going to start this one off by saying this about the iPad.</p>
<p>"Big Ass iPhone"</p>
<p>There is no doubt though that this is the coolest thing that Apple has released in a long time. However, there are a few things that I would have liked to see in it that would make me go out and buy one now.</p>
<p>1. Front Facing Camera</p>
<p>2. Flash Player (Really needs to be there)</p>
<p>3. Mac OS (I'd really like to be able to run Mac native apps on there, rather than iPhone apps. Like Photoshop. That would be good to see on it)</p>
<p>4. A camera at all, really</p>
<p>5. An SD slot without an adaptor</p>
<p>Aside from those things not being there, this is still a really cool device. I don't know how it is performance wise, but I'll talk more about it once I actually get my hands on one. Who knows when that will be, but when it is, I'll go try it out. All I can say about this is that when it was released, I was a little underwhelmed over the features it had. Some things were there, but a few things (FLASH PLAYER!!!) were not there. Oh well, there's always next release.</p>
<p>All for now!<br/></p>
