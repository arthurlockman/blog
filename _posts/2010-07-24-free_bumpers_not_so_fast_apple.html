Yes, I'm talking about the 'Death Grip'. As you probably also know, Apple has 'fixed' this problem by giving everyone a free iPhone case to&nbsp;alleviate&nbsp;the problem. Well, for me, this doesn't cut it. Take Toyota for example. When they had a serious problem with their cars (which turned out to be mostly user error), they started a major recall and fixed the problem. What does apple do? Not a recall, but an addition to their product that 'fixes' the problem. Here's what apple should have done in my opinion. 1: Change the iPhone 4 design so that there is a thin layer of clear plastic around the outer antenna that would prevent the two antennae from being bridged, causing signal loss. This would essentially do the same thing as the bumper does, only more efficiently and easier for the user. And finally 2: Recall all iPhone 4's and either add this coating to the outside of the iPhone or replace them with the newer one. This I feel would be a much better solution to this problem. If anyone has anything better to say about it, let me know. I'd love to hear what you think!
