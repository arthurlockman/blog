<p>In my everlasting search for the perfect way to use the full potential of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://google.com" title="Google" rel="homepage">Google</a> Voice, I have stumbled across several solutions to make free VoIP calls from my Mac. I had stumbled upon <a class="zem_slink" href="http://gizmo5.com/" title="Gizmo5" rel="homepage">Gizmo</a>, which is still what I use for this purpose. However, I today stumbled across a new frontend for Gizmo that makes the whole experience that much better.
<div></div>
<p><img alt="Telephone.jpg" src="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/Telephone.jpg" width="260" height="110" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" />
<div>Enter Telephone, a little SIP Softphone that can connect to basically any kind of SIP service. Sipgate, Gizmo, whatever you may have this app can connect to it. Currently, I have it connected to my Gizmo account, which links to Google Voice. Now as most of my readers probably already know, Google has purchased Gizmo and has shut down sign ups. So unless you were fortunate enough to get a Gizmo account before the shut down, this post probably won't do much but to make you jealous.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyways, back to the point. When you open this app, all you see is a very simple window asking you for a SIP&nbsp;</div>
<div>server, a username, and a password. Once you enter that, it&nbsp;</div>
<p><img alt="Notify.jpg" src="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/Notify.jpg" width="300" height="56" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />
<div>signs you in to the account and allows you to make and receive calls. The application links in with your Mac OS Address book contacts, and allows you to call any of&nbsp;</div>
<div>them. But, if you use it to link to Gizmo and Google Voice, then you can have google call you and it will send a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://growl.info/" title="Growl (software)" rel="homepage">Growl</a> notification from the background alerting you to the call.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<p><img alt="AcceptDecline.jpg" src="https://static.rthr.me/mt_assets/AcceptDecline.jpg" width="300" height="128" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" />
<div>If you click on the Growl notification, it goes to the application and presents you with this window, that asks you whether you want to accept or decline the call. In all very simple. And the best part, it uses about 13 mb of ram while sitting in the background. That's how a softphone should be. No bells and whistles, just let me talk.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This awesome app can be <a href="http://code.google.com/p/telephone/">downloaded from their Google Code Site.</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>All for Now!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Note: Although as of today Google Voice is open to the public, Gizmo5 Signups are still closed. Sorry!</div>
