<p>I just today upgraded to MT5. The dashboard takes a little getting used to, but other than that, it's almost exactly the same as MT4. There's just one thing that I don't like about it. So far as I can tell, the Keywords field is gone. It's just not there. Plus, they moved the publish button, and all the tags and stuff. I'll post a better review when I start to look deeper into it, to look out for more!
