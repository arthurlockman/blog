A little while back I came upon a tool [posted by Edward Mendelson at Columbia University that neatly packaged SheepSaver with a pre-installed image of Mac OS 9](http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/macos9osx.html). I immediately downloaded it and stashed it away _just in case_.

I recently went to actually _use_ this tool and found that it didn't seem to work anymore. The last time I had tried to run it was from a pre-Catalina OS. It turns out that the version of SheepSaver that it had bundled is no longer compatible with Catalina. Shoot.

There is fortunately an easy solution! The same Columbia University site hosts a tool called [SheepSaver Wrapper](http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/sheepshaverwrapper.html), which the `Mac OS 9.app` bundle makes use of to actually run the OS. An update was posted last year to SheepSaver Wrapper that allows it to work on Catalina. Bingo.

To make your copy of `Mac OS 9.app` functional, follow these steps to replace the bundled version of SheepSaver Wrapper with the updated-for-Catalina version.

1. Download both [`Mac OS 9.app`](http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/Mac%20OS%209.zip) and [`SheepSaver Wrapper.app`](http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/SheepShaverWrapper.zip) from Edward Mendelson's website [^1]
2. Right-click on `Mac OS 9.app` and click _Show Package Contents_
3. Navigate to `Contents / Resources / Files`
4. Right-click on `SheepSaver Wrapper.app` and click _Show Package Contents_
5. Navigate to `Contents / Resources / Files`
6. Drag and drop `SheepSaver.app` from `SheepSaver Wrapper.app` into `Mac OS 9.app`

At this point you should be good to go! Start up `Mac OS 9.app` and enjoy some sweet Classic action.

The image comes pre-installed with a few apps, but if you're looking for more I recommend checking out the [Macintosh Repository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org). They have _loads_ of old Mac software available for download.
