<p>Today, we say Happy 26th birthday to the Apple Macintosh! Count 'em! That's 26 Years! </p>
<p> On January 24th, 1984, Steve Jobs pulled a 128K Mac out of its case in front of a crowd of reporters, turned it on, and let the computer introduce itself to the world. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>Over its 26 year history, we've seen our favorite computer go from an awkward infancy, to almost dying in its teens, and now being a profitable prodigy in adulthood. It has spawned the iPod, iPhone, and a whole host of other machines to go along with its streamlined coolness. </p>
<p>But just look how far we've come! From this...</p>

<p>So everyone wish a happy 26th birthday to everyone's favorite computer, and here's to another 26 more!</p>
<p>All for Now!<br/></p>
