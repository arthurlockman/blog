<p>The other night I had the pleasure of being one of the first people to be involved in what I hope will be the first of many <a href="http://themenubar.net">Menu Bar</a> call-in shows. It was a whole lot of fun, and one of the better experiences I&rsquo;ve had within the Apple community. I&rsquo;ve loved listening to <a href="http://themenubar.net">The Menu Bar</a> ever since episode one, and was glad to finally get to be a part of it. If you don&rsquo;t already listen to it, you should give it a try. It&rsquo;s my favorite podcast, and I think you&rsquo;ll like it too.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>EDIT: The episode is now live! <a href="http://themenubar.net/tmb-ep016" target="_blank">Episode 16: Every Zac, Every Story</a></p>
