<p>Ever since <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.adobe.com/" title="Adobe Systems" rel="homepage">Adobe</a> went public with the information that Flash CS5 would publish to iPhone, they have been promoting the impending appearance of Connect Pro for iPhone. Well, that day has finally arrived! Today, Apple approved and posted the download for ACP for iPhone, which you can access by looking for "Adobe" in the app store. What will this mean for web&nbsp;conferencing? Well to me at least, this tells the other web conferencing companies (WebEx, especially) that they no longer have the only web-conferencing solution on the iPhone. Connect is much more versatile, and now anyone can use it from anywhere.
