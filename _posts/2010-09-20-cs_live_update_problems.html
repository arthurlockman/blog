<p>For the past few weeks, I've been trying to install the Adobe CSLive Services update for CS5. However, the update refuses to install. Every time I try I get the same error: "Couldn't install because the package was not applicable". What is this, Adobe? Why do you keep notifying me of an update that isn't applicable to my computer but I can't get rid of the icon from my menubar? I was hoping that maybe there'd be a patch for the update that would fix the problem. It's now been countless weeks since the update first showed up and I've seen no updates or changes to the problem. Hopefully a fix comes out soon for it. It's really starting to bug me.</p>
<p>All for Now!</p>
