<p>I've been using Google Reader for years. I keep in it all of the websites that I keep up on, feeds of webcomics that I like to read, blogs, and any other things that I like to follow on the web.</p>
<p>That being said, I can't say that I will miss it when it goes away in a few months. While reading my feeds each day has become a part of my routine, I've found that I've stopped really reading anything that comes down through Reader, and instead glossing over it and saving one in a hundred articles to Pocket for reading later on. Almost all of the articles that I do end up saving I see later on in my Twitter or App.net feed. Because of this I've realized that I don't really need Google Reader anymore. Anything interesting that I would find through Reader comes to me through the other social networks that I check on throughout the day.</p>
<p>While I am sad to see it go, I won't really miss it all that much. So long Reader, and thanks for all the fish.</p>
