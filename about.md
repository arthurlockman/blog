## Howdy! My name is Arthur Lockman.

I'm a .NET Core and Angular developer at Vistaprint. I specialize in building cloud-first
microservices that power the Vistaprint manufacturing plants.

My background is a degree in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science from Worcester
Polytechnic Institute. As part of my degree I worked on a research project investigating the 
[viability of using drones to eliminate land mines](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031216-112944/).
I also worked on a project to help the city of Santa Fe, NM construct an 
[open government data portal for citizens to access key city information](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-043016-160711/).

In my spare time you can find me [behind a camera](https://www.instagram.com/arthurlockman/) 
taking photos of my friends and family at Walt Disney World (and other places too, I swear).
